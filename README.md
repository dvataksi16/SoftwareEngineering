[Agile programming — for your family](https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_agile_programming_for_your_family)

⋅⋅⋅ Since we recently learned about Agile methodolgies in class, I found this article quite interesting. This article is not about programming but rather how software engineering techniques can be applied to things outside of software engineering, such as integrating Agile programming into family practices. For instance, following the Agile model Bruce Feiler, would hold family meetings to assess what was going well for the family during the past week and what the family can improve on. Feiler states that this method: *"gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts."* He claims that Agile "works for software and works for success" and shares how successful Agile was in his family life. He says that he has been using Agile to raise his kids for years. It goes to show you that these methods, whose key ideas revolve around adaption, can be used in many different fields.

⋅⋅⋅ Well this is a mind f***! Implementing Agile Methodology in to your families and homes! Who knew! I'm all about it! 

Comment:
Definitely an interesting TED talk. I can imagine how the bottom-up idea flow and accountability that define agile could be applied to parenting strategy. In my opinion, this would teach kids the right values, values that would carry on into their adult lives. On the contrary, traditional top-down parenting could result in either lack of assertiveness or excessive rebelliousness in the kid.
