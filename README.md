[Agile programming — for your family] (https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_agile_programming_for_your_family)

Since we recently learned about Agile methodolgies in class, I found this article quite interesting. This article is not about programming but rather how software engineering techniques can be applied to things outside of software engineering, such as integrating Agile programming into family practices. For instance, following the Agile model Bruce Feiler, would hold family meetings to assess what was going well for the family during the past week and what the family can improve on. Feiler states that this method: " gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts." He claims that Agile "works for software and works for success" and shares how successful Agile was in his family life. He says that he has been using Agile to raise his kids for years. It goes to show you that these methods, whose key ideas revolve around adaption, can be used in many different fields.
